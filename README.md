# Car Price Prediction

This project builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict the price of a car based on its features using Python and popular data science libraries.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Develop a regression model capable of predicting car prices using historical data and car characteristics.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Data preprocessing (missing value handling, encoding, etc.)
    
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
    
- Model training using a neural network (MLPRegressor)
    
- Model evaluation with RÂ² score and other metrics
    

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

- Heatmaps for correlation
    
- Scatter plots between price and top features
    
- MLPRegressor performance metrics (RÂ² Score)
    

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The dataset should contain features like year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, etc.
    

## ðŸ§© Future Improvements

- Add more advanced regression models
    
- Hyperparameter tuning
    
- UI for car price prediction
